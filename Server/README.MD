## Server Code

The server code was run on a Virtual Linux server during the hackathon.

script.js is the main server code in Node.js, loop.sh is a shell file that runs the server repeatedly in case the script crashes (Vish Anand)

settingsTemplate.html is the settings webpage in HTML and CSS (JT Thrash)
